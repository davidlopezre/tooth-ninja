Chocolate and fruit juice will attract more bacteria\n if they touch your child’s teeth! However, your child may get a bit upset\n if you don’t let them have any sweet food! Milk and cheese will strengthen\nyour child’s teeth!\n Your child will also be drinking either tap water or\nbottled water – which one will you choose?"

    static let BEGIN_LVL_3 = "Your child is 20 months old.\nDon’t forget to keep swiping away the bacteria from your child’s teeth!\nThere is even more food and drink entering your child’s teeth now!\nYour child will be wanting cola now, and again this will attract\nbacteria to your child’s teeth. Your child will now have the option\nto have dark chocolate and sugar free soda, will this be better\nfor their teeth than normal chocolate and cola?\nYour child is now old enough to have Low Fluoride toothpaste,\nmake sure they get some!"
